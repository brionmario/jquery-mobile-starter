- The most recent version of [jQuery Mobile 1.4.5](http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/)
- The ability to use html, php or jade.
- Usage of [Sass: Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets](https://sass-lang.com/) over CSS.
- Ready to go build system using Gulp.
- Simplified development process with npm scripts.
- Easilily integrate your favourite php libraries using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).
- Ability to use your favorite bower packages.
- Organized and easy to use folder structure for beginners.

# Quick start

> The generated project have dependencies that require `Node.js` together with `npm` & `Composer`.

**Install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) locally or globally by following the instructions listed [here](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-macos).**

**Make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version >= 8.0 and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) >= 5 or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com).**

```bash
# clone our repository
# --depth 1 removes all but one .git commit history
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/brionmario/jquery-mobile-seed.git

# change the directory
cd jquery-mobile-seed

# install the npm dependencies listed on package.json
npm install

# install the composer dependencies listed on composer.json
Composer install

# start the development server
npm start

```

Once the dev server is fired up, it'll automatically open up a new tab. If not, manually navigate to the local URL listed on the terminal(usually [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)).

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

What you need to run this app:

- The generated project have dependencies that require `Node.js` together with `npm` and `Composer`.

> Make sure you have `Node.js`, `npm` & `Composer` installed by running the following simple commands on the command line and see if you're running the latest stable versions.

- Node.js - Type `node -v` on the terminal.
- npm - Type `npm -v` on the terminal.
- Composer - Type `Composer -v` on the terminal.

If you do not have them installed, click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and grab the latest stable version of `Node.js` and `npm` will be automatically installed along with it. Or if you have `brew` already installed in your local machine, execute `brew install node` command to get `node`.

To download composer, click [here](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-macos) and follow the download instructions.

The project requires `bower` to install project scope dependencies such as `bootstrap`, `jquery` etc. but it is not required to install bower on your local machines since `npm` installs `bower` as a project dependency. Also `bower install` command is run automatically by `npm` as a post install script.

In addition we've created `npm scripts` to run `gulp tasks` and `gulp` is installed by npm as a project depency. So you don't have to install `gulp` or `gulp cli` manually on your working machine.

## Setting Up

- `clone` the repository
- `cd jquery-mobile-seed` to change the directory
- `npm install` to install npm dependencies
- `Composer install` to install composer dependencies

## Running the app

After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app. Run `npm start` to start a local server using `gulp` which will watch your stylesheets and javascript files for changes, compile, minify, build and reload the browser automatically using `browser-sync` library.
The dev server will be opened in a new tab and usually on http://localhost:8000 and the Access URLs will be displayed on the terminal.

### server

```bash
# development
npm start

# production
npm run server:prod
```

# Configuration

The `gulp` tasks are defined inside the `gulpfile.babel.js` file found on the root of the application and you need to extend this file if you want to customize the application.

## Add third-party dependencies

### Composer

To integrate PHP libraries from composer, visite the packge repository website([https://packagist.org/](https://packagist.org/)) and follow the instructions. The command to install the package would generally look loke below. Replace the `$package` with the actual package you want to install.

```bash
composer require $package
```

Take a look at the bellow example:

Lets say that you want to integrate `facebook/graph-sdk` to your project. Just run the command bellow.

```bash
composer require facebook/graph-sdk
```

### Bower

To use any third party bower libraries other than the included `jquery-mobile`, `jquery` and `font-awesome` libs, locate the package you want in the [bower package repository](https://bower.io/search/) and use the following command to add it to your project.

```bash
bower install $package --save
```

Take a look at the bellow example:

Lets say that you want to add `moment.js` to your project. Just run the command bellow.

```bash
bower install moment --save
```

NOTE: Some packages won't work as expected and you might have to do overrides in the `bower.json` file.

# Styling

The `styles.scss` file inside the `sass` directory is the main stylesheet for the project and will be compiled and minified into an external `.css` and is embedded in the `index.html` file.
If you want to add your own stylesheet, we recommend that you place it under the `scss/partials` folder and import it in the `styles.scss` file.

For example if you want to include the styles for a slider:

1. Create a `_slider.scss` partial file in the `scss/partials` directory.
2. In `styles.scss` add `@import 'partials/slider.scss';`

For the purpose of the demo, we have overriden the native look and feel of some jQuery mobile components. Feel free to remove them by locating in partials.

# Testing

Execute the following command to run your unit tests. We use [codecov](https://codecov.io/) package to generate test coverage reports and the generated reports can be found in the `coverage` folder.

```bash
npm run test
```

# Linting

Execute the following commands to generate linting for styles and scripts.

```bash
# all
npm run lint

# javascript
npm run lint:scripts

# sass
npm run lint:styles
```

# Deployment

## Building the app

### For Development

Execute the following command to build your files in the development mode. A new folder called `dev` will be created and the artifacts will be saved there.

```bash
npm run build:dev
```

### For Production

Execute the following command to build your files in the production mode. A new folder called `dist` will be created and the artifacts will be saved there.

```bash
npm run build
```
